# Coding challenge

Write a program that will determine the type of a triangle.

It should take the lengths of the triangle’s three sides as input, and return whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
We are looking for solutions that showcase problem solving skills and structural considerations that can be applied to larger and potentially more complex problem domains.
Pay special attention to tests, readability, and error cases.
